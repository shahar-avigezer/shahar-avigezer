ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shahar Avigezer!
I'm a passionate problem solver with a spark of curiosity and fast learning skills. 

I love working on good balance of frontend work to backend challenges. On one end, I love working on backend logic, designing a clear API that integrates seamlessly with the DB models to compose efficient architecture that makes sense. On the other end, as a former UX/UI designer, I have a sweet spot for good design and creating engaging user experience.
